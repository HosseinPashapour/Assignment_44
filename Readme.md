# 1.Students Performance (Regression)

+ In this problem I find a relation between study hours  and grade of students with LLS algorithm.
First of all I made a data for study hours and grades of student with numpy library.
then I wrote a class for LLS algorithm and I use it for predict the slope of a line that pass through students data.

# 2.Boston house-prices (Regression) üè†


+ In this problem I find a relation between house price in boston and other parameter with LLS algorithm.
I use Boston dataset in kaggle site for this problem.
you can find this dataset in below link:
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/puxama/bostoncsv

+ I find correlation of different features indataset to find two feature that have more relation to price of houses.
+ I found these two feature is rm and zn respectively.
then I use my lls algorithm to find two slope.
and then I draw a 3d plot by using matplotlib. I showed my predicted plane and real data in this plot.
you can see this plot in result part second problem.
